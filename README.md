# UnrealEngineQtProGenerator

<b>What is this?</b> This tool allows you to open, build and run your Unreal Engine C++ projects using Qt Creator.

<b>Why the heck would you want to do this?</b> 
Well to be honest you probably wouldn't, but if you're like me and prefer Qt Creator to Visual Studio then this is the project for you!

<b>How do I use this?</b> Just build it using Qt Creator on Windows, run it and follow the instructions.
